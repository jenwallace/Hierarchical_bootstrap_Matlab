# Hierarchical_bootstrap_Matlab
Implementing methods in Matlab from:
Saravanan, V., Berman, G. J., & Sober, S. J. (2019). Application of the hierarchical bootstrap to multi-level data in neuroscience. BioRxiv. Retrieved from http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/819334
and applying to some example data from my own work (preprint at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/714337v1)

All bugs are my own! For the original implementation and more details see the work from the authors: https://github.com/soberlab/Hierarchical-Bootstrap-Paper
